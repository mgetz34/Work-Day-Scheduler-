# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

The motivation for the project was to build a appllication that interfaces with third party APIs, and provides a simple and convenient
solution for the storage of daily notes and tasks with time brackets showing past, future, and present time slots.
This project was built to solve a simple problem; being able to schedule daily tasks and see if they have hppened, or are upcoming.
The application can be closed and reopened and the data will remain, maiking this a convenient application that can run in the background
and be minimized or closed and reopened with ease.
The prinicipals of jQuery commands, interfacing with third-party-APIs, and Bootstrap design were covered and familiarized in this exercise.
